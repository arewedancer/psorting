Problem Definition
Data is contained in a large chunk of memory and reference by char *. However internally
dimension values are long(8 bytes) and measure values double (8 bytes).
long *a = 1; // 0x0001
double *b = 1; // 0x3fff
Derefencing long value with double pointers would result very wrong calcuation.

Sorting long values with double *
However sorting code treats all data as double and surprisingly outputs correct ordering.
Reason is IEEE 754 double precision standard: lower 0- 51 bits are significand. And significand
numbers preserve the same ordering as long values (sign and exponent fields are zero).
Since dimension values are never over pow(2, 51), sorting actually works.
After switching over to long comparisons, we observe a 100~+ performance boost.

Why
Intel x86_64 typically integrates FPU(floating point unit) with SIMD and instructions for double comparisons are: MOVSD, COMISD vs long comparisons: MOV, CMP
where: movsd, mov cost about same number of clock cycles, movsd half the throughput
but comisd twice of clock cycles cmp, and half the throughput of cmp
(https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/9e/bc/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf)

Since comparisons account for over 60%  (or even more) of sorting time, it's not surprising that we have a big performance boost.
